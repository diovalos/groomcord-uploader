# groomcord-uploader
automate video uploading to groomcord
# Wrokflow

part 1:
automate script to crop videos greater than 8mb into equal sub parts and later delete the original file
existing file asks the video to be selected, I need to automate that to such that it iterates through the videos by itself  finds the big files and crops it

part 2:
 add a progress bar when croping process is going on for each video

 part 3:
 from a directory in windows all files should be uploaded to discord channel

 before uploading to discord , write the folder name in which the video is kept and after that upload the video
